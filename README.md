# RUMarino

RUMarino is a UPRM project whose purpose is to create an autonomus underwater vehicle that will compete in the RoboSub competition in California. As part of the marketing strategy, the team wanted a website to prmote the team and the project and eventually obtain more sponsors.

The website was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. **Still under construction!**

Project is currently live at http://www.rumarino.com
